# Nuxeo Web Mobile - When WebEngine meets JQuery Mobile

This add-on provides a WebApp exposing Nuxeo with dedicated views for mobile browsers. All mobile browsers will be automatically redirected to this application.
Note for developers: there is no guarantee the current API will be maintained since we envisage to split the data and the UI restitution.
Test and feedback are very welcome.

About the Nuxeo Web Mobile application: we expose a subset of functionalities of the Nuxeo Platform. Here is an overview of what you can do:

- Automatic redirection to the Web Mobile application.
- Redirection to the document into the Mobile application when JSF request asked.
- Dedicated login page.
- Multiple views are available for a document:
  - Subset of metadata
  - Preview
  - Comments
  - Annotation (just the text, no display over the preview)
  - Relations
  - Content
  - The list of contributors to each document. Clicking on a user will show their data, especially their phone number and mail. It is then possible to send them an email or start a phone call.
- You also have some default actions enabled:
  - Mail it (send a link to the current document to a contact from your address book)
  - Download it (download the attached file)
  - Mail me (ask the server to send the current document to yourself, including the attached file)
- Profile view
  - Access to all users' profiles
  - Phone number (clickable)
  - Email (clickable)
  - Avatar (can only be set from the desktop browser)
  - Edition of first name, last name, phone number, mail.
- There are two different kinds of browsing, always available:
  - Hierarchical: You have a root view that exposes the default domain root children and your personal workspace content. Clicking on an element shows its content or the document view (if it's a leaf).
  - There are two kinds of search:
     - Full text search: from the Home page and the search view
     - Faceted search: you have access to your personal and shared faceted search recorded. You cannot create new faceted search from the mobile application.

This application works on all main mobile browser (WebKits - Android, iOS, BB6 -, Fennec Mobile and Windows Phone - not tested but JQuery is supposed to).
About iOS you have also the possibility to add the application into your springboard: the browser button will be hidden and you will feel like using a built-in application.

Here is the list of Web Mobile bundles you can find inside this addon:
